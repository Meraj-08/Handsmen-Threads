## ABSTRACT  

The project presents the implementation of a customized Salesforce CRM solution for HandsMen Threads, a premium men's fashion and tailoring brand. The objective was to streamline business operations, enhance customer engagement, and maintain data integrity across departments.
The solution involves designing a robust data model featuring five key custom objects: Customer, Order, Product, Inventory, and Marketing Campaign. Business processes were automatically focused: Triggered Flows, Scheduled Flows, Partial Arms, and Apex to handle other confirmations, highly status updates, and proactive stock alerts.
To ensure clean and reliable data, validation rules were established, and a role-based security model was implemented in the Sales, Inventory, and Marketing teams. The solution also includes a scheduled batch job using Apex to enable new sales quantities.
This end-to-end CRM implementation improves customer experience through personalized communication, ensures operational efficiency with automation, and lays a scalable foundation for future business growth using the Salesforce Platform.

## TECHNOLOGY DESCRIPTION

### Salesforce :
Salesforce is a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform that helps businesses manage customer data, automate processes, and improve service, marketing, and sales operations. It provides paths and click tools as well as programmatic capabilities (like APIs and Flows) to build custom business solutions.

### Custom Objects :

Example:

‚Ä¢	Product_ c ‚Äì Stores product details

‚Ä¢	Order_ c ‚Äì Stores orders<br>

### Custom App :<br>
An App in Salesforce is a collection of tabs grouped together for a specific business purpose.
### Profiles :<br>
Profiles define what a user can see, do, and edit in Salesforce. It controls object permissions, field access, and more.<br><br>
### Roles :<br>
Roles control the data visibility in Salesforce's role hierarchy. It's used for sharing settings and reporting.<br><br>
### Permission Sets :<br>
Permission Sets grant additional permissions to users without changing their profile.<br><br>
 
### Validation Rules :<br>
Validation Rules ensure data entered meets business criteria.<br>
Example:<br>
‚Ä¢	Email must contain @gmail.com<br>
‚Ä¢	Stock cannot be negative<br>

### Email Templates :<br>
Predefined formats for sending emails to customers or users.<br>
Example:<br>
‚Ä¢	"Order Confirmation" template<br>

### Flows :<br>
Flows automate business logic without code. They can create, update, or send notifications.<br>
Example:<br>
‚Ä¢	Flow triggers email alerts on new order<br><br>
### Apex :<br>
Apex is Salesforce's object-oriented programming language. It allows developers to write custom logic.<br>
Example: <br>Triggers:<br>
‚Ä¢	Update Total_Amount_of in order<br>
‚Ä¢	Reduce inventory stock<br><br>
